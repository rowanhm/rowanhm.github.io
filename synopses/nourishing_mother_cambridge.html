    Scattered across Cambridge are reliefs depicting an old university emblem, from the year 1600.
    It shows a woman, naked, lactating, beneath which there is an inscription: Alma Mater Cantabrigia.
    This is where the Americanism ‘alma mater’ comes from.
    Translated into English, the inscription reads: Nourishing Mother Cambridge.

    In his feature-length debut, director Rowan Hall Maudslay presents an ethnographic portrayal of Cambridge, a town in the east of England which is famous around the world because it houses a prestigious university with a very long history.
    On the surface, ‘Nourishing Mother Cambridge’ is a film about all the peculiar idiosyncrasies that give texture to this particular town: it is a film about monasteries, a river, latin mottos, tourists, and eels.
    But on another level, ‘Nourishing Mother Cambridge’ is a film about time: a film about all the subtle ways that the past reverberates in the world around us.
